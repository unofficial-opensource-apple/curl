       curl_multi_perform - reads/writes available data from each
       easy handle


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLMcode  curl_multi_perform(CURLM   *multi_handle,   int
       *running_handles);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       When  the  app  thinks  there's  data  available  for  the
       multi_handle, it should call this function  to  read/write
       whatever   there   is   to   read   or  write  right  now.
       curl_multi_perform() returns as soon as  the  reads/writes
       are  done. This function does not require that there actu-
       ally is any data available for reading or that data can be
       written,  it can be called just in case. It will write the
       number of handles that still transfer data in  the  second
       argument's integer-pointer.


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       CURLMcode  type,  general  libcurl  multi  interface error
       code.

       NOTE that this only returns errors etc regarding the whole
       multi  stack.  There might still have occurred problems on
       invidual transfers even when this function returns OK.


</PRE>
<H2>TYPICAL USAGE</H2><PRE>
       Most application will  use  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>fdset</I>  to  get  the
       multi_handle's  file  descriptors,  then  it'll  wait  for
       action on them using select() and as soon as one  or  more
       of them are ready, <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I> gets called.
