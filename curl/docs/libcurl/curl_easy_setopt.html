       curl_easy_setopt - set options for a curl easy handle


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLoption option,
       parameter);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       curl_easy_setopt() is used to tell libcurl how to  behave.
       By  using the appropriate options to <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt</I>, you
       can change libcurl's behavior.  All options are  set  with
       the  <I>option</I> followed by a <I>parameter</I>. That parameter can be
       a long, a function  pointer  or  an  object  pointer,  all
       depending  on  what the specific option expects. Read this
       manual carefully as bad input values may cause libcurl  to
       behave  badly!   You can only set one option in each func-
       tion   call.   A    typical    application    uses    many
       curl_easy_setopt() calls in the setup phase.

       <B>NOTE:</B>  strings  passed  to  libcurl as 'char *' arguments,
       will not be copied by the library. Instead you should keep
       them available until libcurl no longer needs them. Failing
       to do so will cause very odd  behavior  or  even  crashes.
       libcurl  will need them until you call curl_easy_cleanup()
       or you set the  same  option  again  to  use  a  different
       pointer.

       <B>NOTE2:</B>  options  set with this function call are valid for
       the forthcoming data transfers that are performed when you
       invoke  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I>.  The options are not in any way
       reset between transfers, so if you want subsequent  trans-
       fers  with different options, you must change them between
       the transfers.

       The <I>handle</I> is the return code from a <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>init(3)</I>  or
       <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>duphandle(3)</I> call.

<H2>BEHAVIOR OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_VERBOSE</B>
           Set  the  parameter  to non-zero to get the library to
           display a lot of verbose information about its  opera-
           tions.  Very useful for libcurl and/or protocol debug-
           ging and understanding.

           You hardly ever want this set in production  use,  you
           will  almost  always  want  this when you debug/report
           problems. Another neat option  for  debugging  is  the
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>DEBUGFUNCTION</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_HEADER</B>
           A  non-zero parameter tells the library to include the
           data (like HTTP).

       <B>CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to shut of  the
           built-in progress meter completely.

           <B>NOTE:</B> future versions of libcurl is likely to not have
           any built-in progress meter at all.

       <B>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL</B>
           Pass a long. If it is non-zero, libcurl will  not  use
           any  functions  that  install  signal  handlers or any
           functions that cause signals to be sent  to  the  pro-
           cess.  This  option  is  mainly  here  to allow multi-
           threaded unix applications to still set/use all  time-
           out  options  etc,  without  risking  getting signals.

<H2>CALLBACK OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION</B>
           Function pointer that should match the following  pro-
           totype:  <B>size_t</B>  <B>function(</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*ptr,</B>  <B>size_t</B>  <B>size,</B>
           <B>size_t</B> <B>nmemb,</B> <B>void</B> <B>*stream);</B> This function gets called
           by  libcurl  as  soon  as  there is data reveiced that
           needs to be saved. The size of the data pointed to  by
           <I>ptr</I>  is <I>size</I> multiplied with <I>nmemb</I>.  Return the number
           of bytes actually taken care of. If that  amount  dif-
           fers  from  the  amount passed to your function, it'll
           signal an error to the library and it will  abort  the
           transfer and return <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>WRITE</I><B>_</B><I>ERROR</I>.

           Set  the <I>stream</I> argument with the <B>CURLOPT_FILE</B> option.

           <B>NOTE:</B> you will be passed as much data as  possible  in
           all  invokes, but you cannot possibly make any assump-
           tions. It may be one byte, it may  be  thousands.  The
           maximum amount of data that can be passed to the write
           callback  is  defined  in  the  curl.h  header   file:
           CURL_MAX_WRITE_SIZE.

       <B>CURLOPT_WRITEDATA</B>
           Data  pointer to pass to the file write function. Note
           that if you specify the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEFUNCTION</I>, this is
           the  pointer  you'll  get as input. If you don't use a
           callback, you must pass a 'FILE  *'  as  libcurl  will
           pass this to fwrite() when writing data.

           <B>NOTE:</B> If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST
           use the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEFUNCTION</I> if you set  this  option
           or you will experience crashes.

           duced in 7.9.7.

       <B>CURLOPT_READFUNCTION</B>
           Function  pointer that should match the following pro-
           totype:  <B>size_t</B>  <B>function(</B>  <B>void</B>  <B>*ptr,</B>  <B>size_t</B>  <B>size,</B>
           <B>size_t</B> <B>nmemb,</B> <B>void</B> <B>*stream);</B> This function gets called
           by libcurl as soon as it needs to read data  in  order
           to  send  it  to the peer. The data area pointed at by
           the pointer <I>ptr</I> may be filled with at most <I>size</I> multi-
           plied  with  <I>nmemb</I> number of bytes. Your function must
           return the actual number of bytes that you  stored  in
           that  memory area. Returning 0 will signal end-of-file
           to the library and cause it to stop the current trans-
           fer.

       <B>CURLOPT_READDATA</B>
           Data  pointer  to pass to the file read function. Note
           that if you specify the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>READFUNCTION</I>, this  is
           the  pointer you'll get as input. If you don't specify
           a read callback, this must be a valid FILE *.

           <B>NOTE:</B> If you're using libcurl as a win32 DLL, you MUST
           use a <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>READFUNCTION</I> if you set this option.

           This  option  is  also  known with the older name <B>CUR-</B>
           <B>LOPT_INFILE</B>, the name CURLOPT_READDATA was  introduced
           in 7.9.7.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION</B>
           Function     pointer    that    should    match    the
           <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>progress</I><B>_</B><I>callback</I>     prototype     found      in
           <I>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</I>.  This  function  gets called by libcurl
           instead of its internal  equivalent  with  a  frequent
           interval  during  data transfer.  Unknown/unused argu-
           ment values will be set to  zero  (like  if  you  only
           download data, the upload size will remain 0). Return-
           ing a non-zero value from  this  callback  will  cause
           libcurl    to    abort   the   transfer   and   return
           <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>ABORTED</I><B>_</B><I>BY</I><B>_</B><I>CALLBACK</I>.

           Also note that <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>NOPROGRESS</I> must be set to FALSE
           to make this function actually get called.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROGRESSDATA</B>
           Pass  a  pointer that will be untouched by libcurl and
           passed as the first argument in the progress  callback
           set with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROGRESSFUNCTION</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_PASSWDFUNCTION</B>
           Pass a pointer to a <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>passwd</I><B>_</B><I>callback</I> function that
           will be called instead of the internal one if  libcurl
           requests a password. The function must match this pro-
           the function to the internal default one. If the func-
           tion returns a non-zero value, it will abort the oper-
           ation and an error  (CURLE_BAD_PASSWORD_ENTERED)  will
           be  returned.   <I>client</I>  is a generic pointer, see <I>CUR-</I>
           <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDDATA</I>.  <I>prompt</I> is a  zero-terminated  string
           that  is text that prefixes the input request.  <I>buffer</I>
           is a pointer to data where the entered password should
           be  stored  and  <I>buflen</I> is the maximum number of bytes
           that may be written in the buffer.  (Added in 7.4.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_PASSWDDATA</B>
           Pass a void * to whatever data you  want.  The  passed
           pointer  will  be  the  first  argument  sent  to  the
           specifed <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I>  function.  (Added  in
           7.4.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION</B>
           Function  pointer that should match the following pro-
           totype:  <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>  <I>function(</I>  <I>void</I>  <I>*ptr,</I>  <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>  <I>size,</I>
           <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t</I>  <I>nmemb,</I>  <I>void</I>  <I>*stream);</I>.  This  function  gets
           called by libcurl as soon as there is received  header
           data  that  needs  to be written down. The headers are
           guaranteed to be written one-by-one and only  complete
           lines  are  written.  Parsing  headers  should be easy
           enough using this. The size of the data pointed to  by
           <I>ptr</I>  is <I>size</I> multiplied with <I>nmemb</I>.  The pointer named
           <I>stream</I> will be the one you passed to libcurl with  the
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>WRITEHEADER</I>  option.   Return  the  number  of
           bytes actually written or return -1 to signal error to
           the  library  (it  will cause it to abort the transfer
           with  a  <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>WRITE</I><B>_</B><I>ERROR</I>  return  code).  (Added  in
           7.7.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_WRITEHEADER</B>
           Pass  a pointer to be used to write the header part of
           the received data to. If you don't use your own  call-
           back to take care of the writing, this must be a valid
           FILE *. See  also  the  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HEADERFUNCTION</I>  option
           above on how to set a custom get-all-headers callback.

       <B>CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION</B>
           Function pointer that should match the following  pro-
           totype:  <I>int</I>  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>debug</I><B>_</B><I>callback</I>  <I>(CURL</I> <I>*,</I> <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>info-</I>
           <I>type,</I> <I>char</I> <I>*,</I> <I>size</I><B>_</B><I>t,</I>  <I>void</I>  <I>*);</I>  This  function  will
           receive   debug   information  if  CURLOPT_VERBOSE  is
           enabled. The  curl_infotype  argument  specifies  what
           kind of information it is. This funtion must return 0.

       <B>CURLOPT_DEBUGDATA</B>
           Pass a pointer to whatever you want passed in to  your
           CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION  in  the  last  void * argument.
           This pointer is not used by libcurl, it is only passed

       <B>CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER</B>
           Pass  a  char * to a buffer that the libcurl may store
           human readable error messages in.  This  may  be  more
           helpful  than  just  the return code from the library.
           The buffer must be at least CURL_ERROR_SIZE big.

           Use <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>VERBOSE</I> and <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>DEBUGFUNCTION</I> to  bet-
           ter debug/trace why errors happen.

           <B>Note:</B>  if  the  library  does not return an error, the
           buffer may not have been touched. Do not rely  on  the
           contents in those cases.

       <B>CURLOPT_STDERR</B>
           Pass  a FILE * as parameter. This is the stream to use
           instead of stderr internally when reporting errors.

       <B>CURLOPT_FAILONERROR</B>
           A  non-zero  parameter  tells  the  library  to   fail
           silently  if  the  HTTP  code  returned is equal to or
           larger than 300. The default action would be to return
           the page normally, ignoring that code.



</PRE>
<H2>NETWORK OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_URL</B>
           The actual URL to deal with. The parameter should be a
           char * to a zero terminated string.  The  string  must
           remain  present  until  curl no longer needs it, as it
           doesn't copy the string.

           <B>NOTE:</B> this option is (the only one) required to be set
           before <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform(3)</I> is called.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROXY</B>
           Set  HTTP proxy to use. The parameter should be a char
           * to a zero terminated string holding the host name or
           dotted  IP  address.  To  specify  port number in this
           string, append :[port] to the end of  the  host  name.
           The  proxy  string  may be prefixed with [protocol]://
           since any such prefix will  be  ignored.  The  proxy's
           port number may optionally be specified with the sepa-
           rate option <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROXYPORT</I>.

           <B>NOTE:</B> when you tell the library to use a  HTTP  proxy,
           libcurl  will transparently convert operations to HTTP
           even if you specify a FTP URL etc. This  may  have  an
           impact  on  what other features of the library you can
           use, such as CURLOPT_QUOTE and similar  FTP  specifics
           that  don't  work  unless  you tunnel through the HTTP
           proxy. Such tunneling is activated with  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTP-</I>
           <I>PROXYTUNNEL</I>.
           <B>http_proxy</B>, <B>ftp_proxy</B>, <B>all_proxy</B> etc, if any of  those
           is set.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROXYPORT</B>
           Pass  a long with this option to set the proxy port to
           connect to unless it is specified in the proxy  string
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PROXY</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE</B>
           Pass a long with this option to set type of the proxy.
           Available options  for  this  are  CURLPROXY_HTTP  and
           CURLPROXY_SOCKS5,  with  the  HTTP  one being default.
           (Added in 7.10)

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL</B>
           Set the parameter to non-zero to get  the  library  to
           tunnel all operations through a given HTTP proxy. Note
           that there is a big difference between using  a  proxy
           and  to tunnel through it. If you don't know what this
           means, you probably don't want this tunneling  option.
           (Added in 7.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_INTERFACE</B>
           Pass  a  char  *  as parameter. This set the interface
           name to use as outgoing network  interface.  The  name
           can  be  an  interface  name,  an IP address or a host
           name. (Added in 7.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT</B>
           Pass a long, this sets the timeout  in  seconds.  Name
           resolves  will  be  kept  in memory for this number of
           seconds.  Set  to  zero  (0)  to  completely   disable
           caching,  or  set  to  -1  to  make the cached entries
           remain forever. By default, libcurl caches info for 60
           seconds. (Added in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE</B>
           Pass  a  long. If the value is non-zero, it tells curl
           to use a global DNS cache that  will  survive  between
           easy  handle  creations  and  deletions.  This  is not
           thread-safe and this will use a global varible. (Added
           in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE</B>
           Pass  a  long  specifying  your  prefered size for the
           receive buffer in libcurl.  The  main  point  of  this
           would  be  that  the  write  callback gets called more
           often and with smaller chunks. This is just treated as
           a  request,  not an order. You cannot be guaranteed to
           actually get the given size. (Added in 7.10)


       <B>CURLOPT_NETRC</B>
           This parameter  controls  the  preference  of  libcurl
           between  using  user  names  and  passwords  from your
           <I>~/.netrc</I> file, relative to user names and passwords in
           the URL supplied with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>URL</I>.

           <B>Note:</B>  libcurl  uses  a  user  name  (and  supplied or
           prompted password) supplied  with  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>USERPWD</I>  in
           preference  to  any  of the options controlled by this
           parameter.

           Pass a long, set to one of the values described below.

           <B>CURL_NETRC_OPTIONAL</B>
                The  use  of  your <I>~/.netrc</I> file is optional, and
                information in the URL is to be  preferred.   The
                file  will be scanned with the host and user name
                (to find the password  only)  or  with  the  host
                only,  to  find  the first user name and password
                after that <I>machine</I>, which ever information is not
                specified in the URL.

                Undefined  values  of  the  option will have this
                effect.

           <B>CURL_NETRC_IGNORED</B>
                The library will ignore the file and use only the
                information in the URL.

                This is the default.

           <B>CURL_NETRC_REQUIRED</B>
                This value tells the library that use of the file
                is required, to ignore  the  information  in  the
                URL, and to search the file with the host only.

       Only machine name, user name and password are taken into
           account
           (init macros and similar things aren't supported).

           <B>Note:</B> libcurl does not verify that the  file  has  the
           correct  properties  set  (as  the  standard  Unix ftp
           client does). It should only be readable by user.

       <B>CURLOPT_USERPWD</B>
           Pass a char * as  parameter,  which  should  be  [user
           name]:[password]  to  use  for  the connection. If the
           password is left out, you will  be  prompted  for  it.
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I>  can  be  used  to set your own
           prompt function.

       <B>CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD</B>
           proxy. If the  password  is  left  out,  you  will  be
           prompted for it. <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> can be used to
           set your own prompt function.

<H2>HTTP OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_ENCODING</B>
           Two encodings are supported <I>dentity</I>, which does  noth-
           ing, and <I>deflate</I> to request the server to compress its
           reponse using the  zlib  algorithm.  This  is  not  an
           order,  the server may or may not do it.  See the spe-
           cial file lib/README.encoding for details.

       <B>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to  follow  any
           Location:  header  that  the server sends as part of a
           HTTP header.

           <B>NOTE:</B> this means that the  library  will  re-send  the
           same  request on the new location and follow new Loca-
           tion: headers all the way until no more  such  headers
           are  returned.  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>MAXREDIRS</I> can be used to limit
           the number of redirects libcurl will follow.

       <B>CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS</B>
           Pass a long. The set number will  be  the  redirection
           limit.  If  that many redirections have been followed,
           the   next    redirect    will    cause    an    error
           (<I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>TOO</I><B>_</B><I>MANY</I><B>_</B><I>REDIRECTS</I>).  This  option  only  makes
           sense if the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>FOLLOWLOCATION</I>  is  used  at  the
           same time. (Added in 7.5)

       <B>CURLOPT_PUT</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to use HTTP PUT
           to transfer data. The data should  be  set  with  CUR-
           LOPT_READDATA and CURLOPT_INFILESIZE.

       <B>CURLOPT_POST</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to do a regular
           HTTP post. This is  a  normal  application/x-www-form-
           urlencoded  kind,  which is the most commonly used one
           by HTML forms. See the CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS  option  for
           how to specify the data to post and CURLOPT_POSTFIELD-
           SIZE in how  to  set  the  data  size.  Starting  with
           libcurl  7.8,  this option is obsolete. Using the CUR-
           LOPT_POSTFIELDS option will imply this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</B>
           Pass a char * as parameter, which should be  the  full
           data  to post in a HTTP post operation. This is a nor-
           mal application/x-www-form-urlencoded kind,  which  is
           the most commonly used one by HTML forms. See also the

           <B>Note:</B>    to   make   multipart/formdata   posts   (aka
           rfc1867-posts), check out the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPPOST</I> option.

       <B>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE</B>
           If you want to post data to the server without letting
           libcurl do a strlen() to measure the data  size,  this
           option  must be used. When this option is used you can
           post fully binary data, which otherwise is  likely  to
           fail.  If  this  size is set to zero, the library will
           use strlen() to get the size. (Added in libcurl 7.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTPPOST</B>
           Tells libcurl you want a multipart/formdata HTTP  POST
           to  be  made  and you instruct what data to pass on to
           the server.  Pass a pointer to a linked list  of  HTTP
           post  structs as parameter.  The linked list should be
           a fully valid list of 'struct HttpPost' structs  prop-
           erly  filled  in.  The best and most elegant way to do
           this, is to use  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>formadd(3)</I>  as  documented.  The
           data  in  this list must remain intact until you close
           this curl handle again with <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup(3)</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_REFERER</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter. It will be used to set the Referer: header in the
           http request sent to the remote server.  This  can  be
           used  to fool servers or scripts. You can also set any
           custom header with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPHEADER</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_USERAGENT</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  It will be used to set the User-Agent: header in
           the http request sent to the remote server.  This  can
           be  used  to fool servers or scripts. You can also set
           any custom header with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>HTTPHEADER</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER</B>
           Pass a pointer to a linked list  of  HTTP  headers  to
           pass  to  the  server in your HTTP request. The linked
           list should be a fully valid list of <B>struct</B> <B>curl_slist</B>
           structs  properly  filled in. Use <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>append(3)</I>
           to create the list and <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I> to clean
           up  an entire list. If you add a header that is other-
           wise generated and used by  libcurl  internally,  your
           added  one  will  be used instead. If you add a header
           with no contents as in 'Accept:' (no data on the right
           side  of  the  colon), the internally used header will
           get disabled. Thus, using this option you can add  new
           headers,  replace internal headers and remove internal
           headers.

           LOPT_USERAGENT and CURLOPT_REFERER.

       <B>CURLOPT_COOKIE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  It  will  be  used  to  set a cookie in the http
           request. The format of the string should be  NAME=CON-
           TENTS,  where  NAME is the cookie name and CONTENTS is
           what the cookie should contain.

           If you need to set mulitple cookies, you need  to  set
           them  all  using  a single option and thus you need to
           concat them all in one  single  string.  Set  multiple
           cookies  in  one  string  like  this: "name1=content1;
           name2=content2;" etc.

           Using this option multiple times will  only  make  the
           latest string override the previously ones.

       <B>CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. It should contain the name of your  file  holding
           cookie  data  to  read.  The  cookie  data  may  be in
           Netscape / Mozilla cookie data format or just  regular
           HTTP-style headers dumped to a file.

           Given  an empty or non-existing file, this option will
           enable cookies for this curl handle, making it  under-
           stand and parse received cookies and then use matching
           cookies in future request.

       <B>CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR</B>
           Pass a file name as char *, zero terminated. This will
           make libcurl write all internally known cookies to the
           specified file when <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup(3)</I> is called. If
           no cookies are known, no file will be created. Specify
           "-" to instead have the  cookies  written  to  stdout.
           Using  this  option also enables cookies for this ses-
           sion, so if you for example follow a location it  will
           make  matching cookies get sent accordingly. (Added in
           7.9)

       <B>CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION</B>
           Pass a long as parameter. This defines  how  the  CUR-
           LOPT_TIMEVALUE time value is treated. You can set this
           parameter  to  TIMECOND_IFMODSINCE  or  TIMECOND_IFUN-
           MODSINCE. This is a HTTP-only feature. (TBD)

       <B>CURLOPT_TIMEVALUE</B>
           Pass  a  long as parameter. This should be the time in
           seconds since 1 jan 1970, and the time will be used in
           a condition as specified with CURLOPT_TIMECONDITION.

           Pass  a long. If the long is non-zero, this forces the
           HTTP request to get back to GET. Only really usable if
           POST,  PUT  or  a custom request have been used previ-
           ously using the same curl handle. (Added in 7.8.1)

       <B>CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION</B>
           Pass a long, set to one of the values described below.
           They  force libcurl to use the specific HTTP versions.
           This is not sensible to do unless you have a good rea-
           son.

           <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_NONE</B>
                We  don't  care  about  what  version the library
                uses. libcurl will use whatever it thinks fit.

           <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0</B>
                Enforce HTTP 1.0 requests.

           <B>CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_1</B>
                Enforce HTTP 1.1 requests.

<H2>FTP OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_FTPPORT</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  It will be used to get the IP address to use for
           the ftp PORT instruction. The PORT  instruction  tells
           the  remote  server  to  connect  to  our specified IP
           address. The string may be a plain IP address, a  host
           name, an network interface name (under Unix) or just a
           '-' letter to let the library use your systems default
           IP  address.  Default  FTP operations are passive, and
           thus won't use PORT.

       <B>CURLOPT_QUOTE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a linked list  of  FTP  commands  to
           pass  to  the  server  prior to your ftp request. This
           will be done before any other FTP commands are  issued
           (even  before the CWD command). The linked list should
           be a fully valid list of to append strings  (commands)
           to the list, and clear the entire list afterwards with
           <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>slist</I><B>_</B><I>free</I><B>_</B><I>all(3)</I>. Disable this  operation  again
           by setting a NULL to this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE</B>
           Pass  a  pointer  to  a linked list of FTP commands to
           pass to the server after your  ftp  transfer  request.
           The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct
           curl_slist structs properly filled in as described for
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>QUOTE</I>. Disable this operation again by setting
           a NULL to this option.

           Pass a pointer to a linked list  of  FTP  commands  to
           pass to the server after the transfer type is set. The
           linked list should be a fully  valid  list  of  struct
           curl_slist structs properly filled in as described for
           <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>QUOTE</I>. Disable this operation again by setting
           a NULL to this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_FTPLISTONLY</B>
           A  non-zero  parameter  tells the library to just list
           the names of an ftp directory, instead of doing a full
           directory listing that would include file sizes, dates
           etc.

           This causes an FTP NLST command to  be  sent.   Beware
           that  some  FTP  servers  list  only  files  in  their
           response to NLST; they might not  include  subdirecto-
           ries and symbolic links.

       <B>CURLOPT_FTPAPPEND</B>
           A  non-zero  parameter  tells the library to append to
           the remote file instead of overwrite it. This is  only
           useful when uploading to a ftp site.

       <B>CURLOPT_FTP_USE_EPSV</B>
           Pass  a  long. If the value is non-zero, it tells curl
           to use the EPSV command when doing passive  FTP  down-
           loads  (which  it  always does by default). Using EPSV
           means that it will first attempt to  use  EPSV  before
           using  PASV,  but  if  you  pass  FALSE (zero) to this
           option, it will not try using EPSV, only plain PASV.



</PRE>
<H2>PROTOCOL OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_TRANSFERTEXT</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library  to  use  ASCII
           mode  for ftp transfers, instead of the default binary
           transfer. For LDAP transfers it gets the data in plain
           text instead of HTML and for win32 systems it does not
           set the stdout to binary  mode.  This  option  can  be
           usable  when  transferring  text  data between systems
           with different views on certain  characters,  such  as
           newlines or similar.

       <B>CURLOPT_CRLF</B>
           Convert Unix newlines to CRLF newlines on transfers.

       <B>CURLOPT_RANGE</B>
           Pass  a  char * as parameter, which should contain the
           specified range you want. It should be in  the  format
           "X-Y",  where  X  or Y may be left out. HTTP transfers
           also support several intervals, separated with  commas
           as in <I>"X-Y,N-M"</I>. Using this kind of multiple intervals
           techniques).

       <B>CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM</B>
           Pass a long as parameter. It contains  the  offset  in
           number  of  bytes  that you want the transfer to start
           from.

       <B>CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter. It will be user instead of GET or HEAD when doing
           the HTTP request. This is useful for doing  DELETE  or
           other  more  or  less  obscure HTTP requests. Don't do
           this at will, make sure your server supports the  com-
           mand first.

       <B>CURLOPT_FILETIME</B>
           Pass  a  long. If it is a non-zero value, libcurl will
           attempt to get the modification  date  of  the  remote
           document  in  this  operation.  This requires that the
           remote server sends the time  or  replies  to  a  time
           querying  command.  The  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>getinfo(3)</I> function
           with the <I>CURLINFO</I><B>_</B><I>FILETIME</I> argument can be used  after
           a  transfer  to  extract  the  received time (if any).
           (Added in 7.5)

       <B>CURLOPT_NOBODY</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to not  include
           the body-part in the output. This is only relevant for
           protocols that have separate header and body parts.

       <B>CURLOPT_INFILESIZE</B>
           When uploading a file to a remote  site,  this  option
           should  be used to tell libcurl what the expected size
           of the infile is.

       <B>CURLOPT_UPLOAD</B>
           A non-zero parameter tells the library to prepare  for
           an upload. The CURLOPT_READDATA and CURLOPT_INFILESIZE
           are also interesting for uploads.



</PRE>
<H2>CONNECTION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_TIMEOUT</B>
           Pass a long as parameter containing the  maximum  time
           in  seconds that you allow the libcurl transfer opera-
           tion to take. Normally, name lookups can take  a  con-
           siderable  time and limiting operations to less than a
           few minutes risk aborting perfectly normal operations.
           This  option  will  cause  curl  to use the SIGALRM to
           enable time-outing system calls.

           <B>NOTE:</B> this is not recommended to use  in  unix  multi-

       <B>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT</B>
           Pass a long as parameter.  It  contains  the  transfer
           speed  in bytes per second that the transfer should be
           below during CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME  seconds  for  the
           library to consider it too slow and abort.

       <B>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_TIME</B>
           Pass a long as parameter. It contains the time in sec-
           onds that  the  transfer  should  be  below  the  CUR-
           LOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT  for  the  library to consider it
           too slow and abort.

       <B>CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS</B>
           Pass a long. The set number  will  be  the  persistent
           connection cache size. The set amount will be the max-
           imum amount of simultaneously  open  connections  that
           libcurl  may cache. Default is 5, and there isn't much
           point in changing this value unless you are  perfectly
           aware   of   how   this  work  and  changes  libcurl's
           behaviour. This concerns connection using any  of  the
           protocols that support persistent connections.

           When  reaching  the  maximum limit, curl uses the <I>CUR-</I>
           <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>CLOSEPOLICY</I> to figure out which of  the  existing
           connections  to  close  to  prevent the number of open
           connections to increase.

           <B>NOTE:</B> if you already  have  performed  transfers  with
           this  curl  handle, setting a smaller MAXCONNECTS than
           before may cause open connections to get closed unnec-
           essarily. (Added in 7.7)

       <B>CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY</B>
           Pass  a  long.  This  option  sets what policy libcurl
           should use when the connection cache is filled and one
           of  the open connections has to be closed to make room
           for a new connection. This must be one  of  the  CURL-
           CLOSEPOLICY_*      defines.      Use     <I>CURLCLOSEPOL-</I>
           <I>ICY</I><B>_</B><I>LEAST</I><B>_</B><I>RECENTLY</I><B>_</B><I>USED</I> to make libcurl close the con-
           nection  that was least recently used, that connection
           is also least likely to  be  capable  of  re-use.  Use
           <I>CURLCLOSEPOLICY</I><B>_</B><I>OLDEST</I>  to make libcurl close the old-
           est connection, the one that was created  first  among
           the  ones  in  the  connection  cache. The other close
           policies are not support yet. (Added in 7.7)

       <B>CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT</B>
           Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next transfer
           use  a new (fresh) connection by force. If the connec-
           tion cache is full before this connection, one of  the
           existing  connections  will  be closed as according to
           does. Set this to 0 to have libcurl  attempt  re-using
           an  existing connection (default behavior).  (Added in
           7.7)

       <B>CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE</B>
           Pass a long. Set to non-zero to make the next transfer
           explicitly  close  the connection when done. Normally,
           libcurl keep all connections alive when done with  one
           transfer in case there comes a succeeding one that can
           re-use them.  This option should be used with  caution
           and  only  if you understand what it does. Set to 0 to
           have libcurl keep the  connection  open  for  possibly
           later re-use (default behavior). (Added in 7.7)

       <B>CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT</B>
           Pass  a  long.  It  should contain the maximum time in
           seconds that you allow the connection to the server to
           take.   This only limits the connection phase, once it
           has connected, this option is of no more use.  Set  to
           zero  to disable connection timeout (it will then only
           timeout on the system's internal timeouts).  See  also
           the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>TIMEOUT</I> option.

           <B>NOTE:</B>  this  is  not recommended to use in unix multi-
           threaded programs, as  it  uses  signals  unless  CUR-
           LOPT_NOSIGNAL (see above) is set.

<H2>SSL and SECURITY OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERT</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. The string should be the file name of  your  cer-
           tificate.  The  default  format  is  "PEM"  and can be
           changed with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLCERTTYPE</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  The string should be the format of your certifi-
           cate. Supported formats are "PEM" and  "DER".   (Added
           in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLCERTPASSWD</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. It will be used as the password required  to  use
           the  CURLOPT_SSLCERT  certificate.  If the password is
           not supplied,  you  will  be  prompted  for  it.  <I>CUR-</I>
           <I>LOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWDFUNCTION</I> can be used to set your own prompt
           function.

           <B>NOTE:</B>This option is replaced  by  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEYPASSWD</I>
           and  only  cept  for backward compatibility. You never
           needed a pass phrase to load  a  certificate  but  you
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. The string should be the file name of  your  pri-
           vate  key.  The  default  format  is  "PEM" and can be
           changed with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEYTYPE</I>. (Added in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  The  string should be the format of your private
           key. Supported formats are  "PEM",  "DER"  and  "ENG".
           (Added in 7.9.3)

           <B>NOTE:</B>The  format "ENG" enables you to load the private
           key from a crypto engine. in this case  <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEY</I>
           is  used  as  an  identifier passed to the engine. You
           have to set the crypto engine with <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I>.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLKEYPASSWD</B>
           Pass  a pointer to a zero terminated string as parame-
           ter. It will be used as the password required  to  use
           the <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>SSLKEY</I> private key. If the password is not
           supplied, you will be prompted for it. <I>CURLOPT</I><B>_</B><I>PASSWD-</I>
           <I>FUNCTION</I>  can be used to set your own prompt function.
           (Added in 7.9.3)

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_ENGINE</B>
           Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as  parame-
           ter.  It will be used as the identifier for the crypto
           engine you want to use for your private key. (Added in
           7.9.3)

           <B>NOTE:</B>If   the   crypto   device   cannot   be  loaded,
           <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I><B>_</B><I>NOTFOUND</I> is returned.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_ENGINEDEFAULT</B>
           Sets the actual crypto engine as the default for (asy-
           metric) crypto operations. (Added in 7.9.3)

           <B>NOTE:</B>If    the    crypto   device   cannot   be   set,
           <I>CURLE</I><B>_</B><I>SSL</I><B>_</B><I>ENGINE</I><B>_</B><I>SETFAILED</I> is returned.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSLVERSION</B>
           Pass a long as parameter. Set what version of  SSL  to
           attempt  to  use,  2 or 3. By default, the SSL library
           will try to solve this by itself although some servers
           make  this  difficult why you at times may have to use
           this option.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</B>
           Pass a long that is set to a non-zero  value  to  make
           curl verify the peer's certificate. The certificate to
           verify  against  must  be  specified  with  the   CUR-
           LOPT_CAINFO  option  (Added in 7.4.2) or a certificate

       <B>CURLOPT_CAINFO</B>
           Pass  a  char  *  to a zero terminated string naming a
           file holding one or more certificates  to  verify  the
           peer with. This only makes sense when used in combina-
           tion with the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option. (Added in
           7.4.2)

       <B>CURLOPT_CAPATH</B>
           Pass  a  char  *  to a zero terminated string naming a
           directory holding multiple CA certificates  to  verify
           the  peer with. The certificate directory must be pre-
           pared using the openssl c_rehash  utility.  This  only
           makes  sense  when  used  in combination with the CUR-
           LOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option. The CAPATH function appar-
           ently  does not work in Windows due to some limitation
           in openssl. (Added in 7.9.8)

       <B>CURLOPT_RANDOM_FILE</B>
           Pass a char * to a zero terminated file name. The file
           will  be  used  to read from to seed the random engine
           for SSL. The more random the specified  file  is,  the
           more secure the SSL connection will become.

       <B>CURLOPT_EGDSOCKET</B>
           Pass  a char * to the zero terminated path name to the
           Entropy Gathering Daemon socket. It will  be  used  to
           seed the random engine for SSL.

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</B>
           Pass  a  long. Set if we should verify the Common name
           from the peer certificate in the SSL handshake, set  1
           to  check  existence,  2 to ensure that it matches the
           provided hostname. (Added in 7.8.1)

       <B>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</B>
           Pass a char *, pointing to a  zero  terminated  string
           holding the list of ciphers to use for the SSL connec-
           tion. The list must be syntactly correct, it  consists
           of  one  or  more  cipher strings separated by colons.
           Commas or spaces are also  acceptable  separators  but
           colons  are  normally  used,  , - and + can be used as
           operators. Valid  examples  of  cipher  lists  include
           'RC4-SHA',  'SHA1+DES',  'TLSv1'  and  'DEFAULT'.  The
           default list is normally set when you compile OpenSSL.

           You'll  find  more  details about cipher lists on this
           URL: <I>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</I>

       <B>CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL</B>
           Pass a char * as  parameter.  Set  the  krb4  security
           level,  this  also  enables krb4 awareness.  This is a
           'private' will be used. Set the string to NULL to dis-
           able  kerberos4.  The  kerberos support only works for
           FTP. (Added in 7.3)



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       CURLE_OK (zero) means that the option  was  set  properly,
       non-zero means an error occurred as <I>&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</I> defines.
       See the <I>libcurl-errors.3</I> man page for the full  list  with
