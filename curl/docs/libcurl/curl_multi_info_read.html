       curl_multi_info_read - read multi stack informationals


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLMsg *curl_multi_info_read( CURLM *multi_handle,
                                      int *msgs_in_queue);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Ask  the multi handle if there's any messages/information-
       als from the individual transfers. Messages include infor-
       mationals  such as an error code from the transfer or just
       the fact that a transfer is  completed.  More  details  on
       these should be written down as well.

       Repeated  calls  to this function will return a new struct
       each time,  until  a  special  "end  of  msgs"  struct  is
       returned  as a signal that there is no more to get at this
       point. The integer pointed to with <I>msgs</I><B>_</B><I>in</I><B>_</B><I>queue</I> will con-
       tain  the number of remaining messages after this function
       was called.

       The data the returned pointer points to will  not  survive
       calling curl_multi_cleanup().

       The  'CURLMsg' struct is very simple and only contain very
       basic  informations.   If  more  involved  information  is
       wanted,  the  particular  "easy handle" in present in that
       struct  and  can  thus  be  used  in  subsequent   regular
       curl_easy_getinfo() calls (or similar).


</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       A  pointer  to a filled-in struct, or NULL if it failed or
       ran out of structs. It also writes the number of  messages
       left  in  the  queue  (after this read) in the integer the
       second argument points to.
