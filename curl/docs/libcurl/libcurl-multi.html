       libcurl-multi - how to use the multi interface


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This is an overview on how to use the libcurl multi inter-
       face in your C programs. There are specific man pages  for
       each function mentioned in here. There's also the libcurl-
       the-guide document for a complete tutorial to  programming
       with  libcurl  and the <I>libcurl(3)</I> man page for an overview
       of the libcurl easy interface.

       All functions in the multi  interface  are  prefixed  with
       curl_multi.


</PRE>
<H2>PLEASE NOTICE</H2><PRE>
       The  multi interface is a rather new member of the libcurl
       family. It has not yet been very widely used. It may still
       be  a  few more bugs lurking in there than we are used to.
       That said, it might also just work in every aspect you try
       it. Please report all bugs and oddities you see.


</PRE>
<H2>OBJECTIVES</H2><PRE>
       The  multi interface introduces several new abilities that
       the easy interface refuses to offer. They are mainly:

       1. Enable a "pull" interface. The  application  that  uses
       libcurl  decides where and when to ask libcurl to get/send
       data.

       2. Enable multiple  simultaneous  transfers  in  the  same
       thread  without making it complicated for the application.

       3. Enable the application to  select()  on  its  own  file
       descriptors  and curl's file descriptors simultaneous eas-
       ily.


</PRE>
<H2>ONE MULTI HANDLE MANY EASY HANDLES</H2><PRE>
       To use the multi interface, you must first create a 'multi
       handle'  with <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>init</I>. This handle is then used as
       input to all further curl_multi_* functions.

       Each single transfer is built up with an easy handle.  You
       must  create  them,  and setup the appropriate options for
       each easy handle, as outlined in the <I>libcurl(3)</I> man  page,
       using <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>setopt(3)</I>.

       When the easy handle is setup for a transfer, then instead
       of using <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I> (as when using the easy  inter-
       face  for transfers), you should instead add the easy han-
       dle to the multi  handle  using  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>add</I><B>_</B><I>handl</I>.  The
       multi  handle  is sometimes referred to as a 'multi stack'
       because of the fact that it may hold  a  large  amount  of
       easy handles.
       removed from the multi stack using  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>remove</I><B>_</B><I>han-</I>
       <I>dle</I>. Once removed from the multi handle, you can again use
       other easy interface functions like  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I>  on
       the handle or whatever you think is necessary.

       Adding  the easy handle to the multi handle does not start
       the transfer.  Remember that one of the  main  ideas  with
       this interface is to let your application drive. You drive
       the transfers by invoking <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I>. libcurl will
       then  transfer  data  if  there  is  anything available to
       transfer. It'll use the callbacks and everything else  you
       have  setup in the individual easy handles. It'll transfer
       data on all current transfers in the multi stack that  are
       ready to transfer anything. It may be all, it may be none.

       Your application can acquire knowledge from  libcurl  when
       it would like to get invoked to transfer data, so that you
       don't have to busy-loop and call  that  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I>
       like  crazy.  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>fdset</I>  offers  an interface using
       which you can extract  fd_sets  from  libcurl  to  use  in
       select()  or poll() calls in order to get to know when the
       transfers in the multi stack might  need  attention.  This
       also makes it very easy for your program to wait for input
       on your own private file descriptors at the same  time  or
       perhaps  timeout every now and then, should you want that.

       A little note here about the return codes from  the  multi
       functions,  and  especially the <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I>: if you
       receive <I>CURLM</I><B>_</B><I>CALL</I><B>_</B><I>MULTI</I><B>_</B><I>PERFORM</I>, this basicly means  that
       you should call <I>curlm</I><B>_</B><I>call</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I> again, before you
       select() on more actions. You don't have to do it  immedi-
       ately,  but  the  return  code means that libcurl may have
       more data available to return or that there  may  be  more
       data to send off before it is "satisfied".

       <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>perform</I>  stores  the  number  of  still running
       transfers in one of its input arguments,  and  by  reading
       that  you  can  figure  out  when all the transfers in the
       multi handles are done. 'done' does not  mean  successful.
       One  or  more  of  the transfers may have failed. Tracking
       when this number changes, you know when one or more trans-
       fers are done.

       To  get  information  about completed transfers, to figure
       out  success  or  not  and  similar,  <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>multi</I><B>_</B><I>info</I><B>_</B><I>read</I>
       should  be called. It can return a message about a current
       or previous transfer. Repeated invokes of the function get
       more messages until the message queue is empty. The infor-
       mation you receive there includes an easy  handle  pointer
       which you may use to identify which easy handle the infor-
       mation regards.

       please   note    that    you    <B>MUST</B>    invoke    separate
       <I>curl</I><B>_</B><I>easy</I><B>_</B><I>cleanup</I>  calls  on  every  single easy handle to
       clean them up properly.

       If you want to re-use an easy handle that was added to the
       multi  handle  for transfer, you must first remove it from
       the multi stack and then re-add it again  (possbily  after
       having altered some options at your own choice).
