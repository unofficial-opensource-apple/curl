       curl - transfer a URL


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>curl</B> <B>[options]</B> <I>[URL...]</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>curl</B> is a client to get documents/files from or send docu-
       ments to a server, using any of  the  supported  protocols
       (HTTP,  HTTPS,  FTP,  GOPHER, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE).
       The command is designed to work without  user  interaction
       or any kind of interactivity.

       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support,
       user authentication, ftp upload, HTTP post,  SSL  (https:)
       connections, cookies, file transfer resume and more.


</PRE>
<H2>URL</H2><PRE>
       The  URL  syntax  is  protocol  dependent.  You'll  find a
       detailed description in RFC 2396.

       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by  writing
       part sets within braces as in:

        http://site.{one,two,three}.com

       or  you  can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using
       [] as in:

        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[1-100].txt
        ftp://ftp.numericals.com/file[001-100].txt    (with lead-
       ing zeros)
        ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt

       It  is  possible  to  specify up to 9 sets or series for a
       URL, but no nesting is supported at the moment:

        http://www.any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol-
       ume[1-4]part{a,b,c,index}.html

       You  can  specify  any amount of URLs on the command line.
       They will be fetched in a sequential manner in the  speci-
       fied order.

       Curl  will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file
       transfers, so that getting many files from the same server
       will  not do multiple connects / handshakes. This improves
       speed. Of course this is only done on files specified on a
       single  command  line  and cannot be used between separate
       curl invokes.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       -a/--append
              writing it. If the file doesn't exist, it  will  be
              created.

              If  this  option is used twice, the second one will
              disable append mode again.

       -A/--user-agent &lt;agent string&gt;
              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the
              HTTP  server.  Some badly done CGIs fail if its not
              set to "Mozilla/4.0".   To  encode  blanks  in  the
              string,  surround  the  string  with  single  quote
              marks.  This can also be set with  the  -H/--header
              flag of course.

              If  this option is set more than once, the last one
              will be the one that's used.

       -b/--cookie &lt;name=data&gt;
              (HTTP) Pass the  data  to  the  HTTP  server  as  a
              cookie.   It  is  supposedly  the  data  previously
              received from the server in a  "Set-Cookie:"  line.
              The  data  should  be  in the format "NAME1=VALUE1;
              NAME2=VALUE2".

              If no '=' letter is used in the line, it is treated
              as  a  filename  to  use  to read previously stored
              cookie lines from, which should  be  used  in  this
              session if they match. Using this method also acti-
              vates the "cookie  parser"  which  will  make  curl
              record  incoming cookies too, which may be handy if
              you're  using  this   in   combination   with   the
              -L/--location  option.  The file format of the file
              to read cookies from should be plain  HTTP  headers
              or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.

              <B>NOTE</B>  that  the  file specified with -b/--cookie is
              only used as input. No cookies will  be  stored  in
              the  file.  To store cookies, save the HTTP headers
              to a file using -D/--dump-header!

              If this option is set more than once, the last  one
              will be the one that's used.

       -B/--use-ascii
              Use ASCII transfer when getting an FTP file or LDAP
              info. For FTP, this can also be enforced  by  using
              an URL that ends with ";type=A". This option causes
              data sent to stdout to be in text  mode  for  win32
              systems.

              If  this  option is used twice, the second one will
              disable ASCII usage.
              (SSL) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connec-
              tion.  The  list  of  ciphers  must  be using valid
              ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on this
              URL:  <I>http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</I>
              <I>(Option</I> <I>added</I> <I>in</I> <I>curl</I> <I>7.9)</I>

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will override the others.

       --connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;
              Maximum  time in seconds that you allow the connec-
              tion to the server to take.  This only  limits  the
              connection  phase,  once  curl  has  connected this
              option is of no more use. See also  the  <I>--max-time</I>
              option.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       -c/--cookie-jar &lt;file name&gt;
              Specify to which file you want curl  to  write  all
              cookies  after  a  completed operation. Curl writes
              all cookies previously read from a  specified  file
              as   well  as  all  cookies  received  from  remote
              server(s). If no cookies are known, no file will be
              written.   The  file  will  be  written  using  the
              Netscape cookie file format. If you  set  the  file
              name  to  a  single  dash, "-", the cookies will be
              written to stdout. (Option added in curl 7.9)

              If this option is  used  several  times,  the  last
              specfied file name will be used.

       -C/--continue-at &lt;offset&gt;
              Continue/Resume  a  previous  file  transfer at the
              given offset. The given offset is the exact  number
              of  bytes  that  will  be  skipped counted from the
              beginning of the source file before  it  is  trans-
              fered  to  the  destination.  If used with uploads,
              the ftp server command SIZE will  not  be  used  by
              curl.

              Use  "-C  -" to tell curl to automatically find out
              where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses  the
              given output/input files to figure that out.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       --crlf (FTP) Convert LF to CRLF in upload. Useful for  MVS
              (OS/390).


       -d/--data &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP) Sends the specified data in a  POST  request
              to the HTTP server, in a way that can emulate as if
              a user has filled in a HTML form  and  pressed  the
              submit  button.  Note that the data is sent exactly
              as specified with no  extra  processing  (with  all
              newlines  cut  off).   The  data  is expected to be
              "url-encoded". This will cause  curl  to  pass  the
              data  to the server using the content-type applica-
              tion/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to -F. If  more
              than  one -d/--data option is used on the same com-
              mand line, the data pieces specified will be merged
              together  with  a  separating &amp;-letter. Thus, using
              '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy'  would  generate  a
              post        chunk       that       looks       like
              'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.

              If you start the data with the letter @,  the  rest
              should  be  a file name to read the data from, or -
              if you want curl to read the data from stdin.   The
              contents  of  the file must already be url-encoded.
              Multiple files can also be specified. Posting  data
              from  a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with
              "--data @foobar".

              To post data purely binary, you should instead  use
              the --data-binary option.

              -d/--data is the same as --data-ascii.

              If this option is used several times, the ones fol-
              lowing the first will append data.

       --data-ascii &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP) This is an alias for the -d/--data option.

              If this option is used several times, the ones fol-
              lowing the first will append data.

       --data-binary &lt;data&gt;
              (HTTP)  This  posts  data  in  a  similar manner as
              --data-ascii does, although when using this  option
              the  entire  context of the posted data is kept as-
              is. If you want to post a binary file  without  the
              strip-newlines  feature of the --data-ascii option,
              this is for you.

              If this option is used several times, the ones fol-
              lowing the first will append data.

       --disable-epsv
              normally  always  first  attempt to use EPSV before
              PASV, but with this option, it will not  try  using
              EPSV.

              If  this  option is used several times, each occur-
              rence will toggle this on/off.

       -D/--dump-header &lt;file&gt;
              Write the protocol headers to the specified file.

              This option is handy to use when you want to  store
              the  cookies  that  a  HTTP  site sends to you. The
              cookies could then be read in a second curl  invoke
              by using the -b/--cookie option!

              When used on FTP, the ftp server response lines are
              considered  being  "headers"  and  thus  are  saved
              there.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       -e/--referer &lt;URL&gt;
              (HTTP) Sends the "Referer Page" information to  the
              HTTP   server.  This  can  also  be  set  with  the
              -H/--header  flag  of  course.   When   used   with
              <I>-L/--location</I> you can append ";auto" to the referer
              URL to make curl automatically set the previous URL
              when  it  follows  a  Location: header. The ";auto"
              string can be used alone, even if you don't set  an
              initial referer.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       --environment
              (RISC OS ONLY) Sets a range  of  environment  vari-
              ables,  using  the names the -w option supports, to
              easier allow extraction of useful information after
              having run curl.

              If  this  option is used several times, each occur-
              rence will toggle this on/off.

       --egd-file &lt;file&gt;
              (HTTPS) Specify the path name to the Entropy  Gath-
              ering Daemon socket. The socket is used to seed the
              random engine for SSL  connections.  See  also  the
              <I>--random-file</I> option.

       -E/--cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;
              (HTTPS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate
              password isn't specified, it will be queried for on
              the  terminal.  Note  that  this certificate is the
              private key and the  private  certificate  concate-
              nated!

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       --cacert &lt;CA certificate&gt;
              (HTTPS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate
              file  to verify the peer. The file may contain mul-
              tiple CA certificates. The certificate(s)  must  be
              in PEM format.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       --capath &lt;CA certificate directory&gt;
              (HTTPS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate
              directory to verify the peer. The certificates must
              be in PEM format, and the directory must have  been
              processed  using the c_rehash utility supplied with
              openssl. Certificate directories are not  supported
              under  Windows  (because  c_rehash  uses  symbolink
              links to create them).  Using  --capath  can  allow
              curl  to  make  https  connections  much more effi-
              ciently than using --cacert if  the  --cacert  file
              contains many CA certificates.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       -f/--fail
              (HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all)  on  server
              errors.  This  is  mostly  done like this to better
              enable scripts  etc  to  better  deal  with  failed
              attempts.  In normal cases when a HTTP server fails
              to deliver a document, it returns a  HTML  document
              stating  so  (which  often  also  describes why and
              more). This flag will prevent curl from  outputting
              that and fail silently instead.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable silent failure.

       -F/--form &lt;name=content&gt;
              (HTTP) This lets curl emulate a filled in  form  in
              which  a  user  has pressed the submit button. This
              causes curl to POST  data  using  the  content-type
              multipart/form-data   according  to  RFC1867.  This
              enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the
              'content'  part  to  be  be a file, prefix the file
              &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is  then  that  @
              makes  a  file  get  attached in the post as a file
              upload, while the &lt; makes a text field and just get
              the contents for that text field from a file.

              Example,  to send your password file to the server,
              where 'password' is the name of the  form-field  to
              which /etc/passwd will be the input:

              <B>curl</B> -F password=@/etc/passwd www.mypasswords.com

              To  read  the file's content from stdin insted of a
              file, use - where the  file  name  should've  been.
              This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs.

              This option can be used multiple times.

       -g/--globoff
              This option switches off the "URL globbing parser".
              When you set this option, you can specify URLs that
              contain  the letters {}[] without having them being
              interpreted by curl itself. Note that these letters
              are  not  normal legal URL contents but they should
              be encoded according to the URI standard.

       -G/--get
              When used, this option will make all data specified
              with  -d/--data  or  --data-binary  to be used in a
              HTTP GET request instead of the POST  request  that
              otherwise  would be used. The data will be appended
              to the URL with a '?'  separator. (Option added  in
              curl 7.9)

              If  used in combination with -I, the POST data will
              instead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.

              If used multiple times, nothing special happens.

       -h/--help
              Usage help.

       -H/--header &lt;header&gt;
              (HTTP) Extra header to use when getting a web page.
              You may specify any number of extra  headers.  Note
              that if you should add a custom header that has the
              same name as one of the internal  ones  curl  would
              use,  your  externally  set  header  will  be  used
              instead of the internal one.  This  allows  you  to
              make  even  trickier stuff than curl would normally
              do. You should not replace internally  set  headers
              without  knowing  perfectly well what you're doing.
              Replacing an internal header with one without  con-

              This  option  can  be  used   multiple   times   to
              add/replace/remove multiple headers.

       -i/--include
              (HTTP)  Include  the HTTP-header in the output. The
              HTTP-header includes things like server-name,  date
              of the document, HTTP-version and more...

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable header include.

       --interface &lt;name&gt;
              Perform an operation using a  specified  interface.
              You  can  enter  interface name, IP address or host
              name. An example could look like:

              <B>curl</B> <B>--interface</B> <B>eth0:1</B> <B>http://www.netscape.com/</B>

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used.

       -I/--head
              (HTTP/FTP) Fetch the HTTP-header only! HTTP-servers
              feature the command HEAD which  this  uses  to  get
              nothing  but the header of a document. When used on
              a FTP file, curl displays the file size only.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable header only.

       -j/--junk-session-cookies
              (HTTP)  When  curl  is  told to read cookies from a
              given file, this option will make  it  discard  all
              "session  cookies". This will basicly have the same
              effect as if a  new  session  is  started.  Typical
              browsers   always   discard  session  cookies  when
              they're closed down. (Added in 7.9.7)

              If this option is used several times,  each  occur-
              rence will toggle this on/off.

       -k/--insecure
              (SSL) This option explicitly allows curl to perform
              "insecure" SSL connections and transfers.  Starting
              with   curl  7.10,  all  SSL  connections  will  be
              attempted to be made secure by using  the  CA  cer-
              tificate  bundle  installed  by default. This makes
              all  connections  considered  "insecure"  to   fail
              unless -k/--insecure is used.

              If  this option is used twice, the second time will
              (FTP) Enable kerberos4 authentication and use.  The
              level must be entered and should be one of 'clear',
              'safe', 'confidential' or 'private'. Should you use
              a  level  that  is not one of these, 'private' will
              instead be used.

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used.

       -K/--config &lt;config file&gt;
              Specify  which  config  file to read curl arguments
              from. The config file is a text file in which  com-
              mand  line arguments can be written which then will
              be used as if they were written on the actual  com-
              mand  line.  Options  and  their parameters must be
              specified on the same  config  file  line.  If  the
              parameter is to contain white spaces, the parameter
              must be inclosed within quotes.  If the first  col-
              umn  of  a config line is a '#' character, the rest
              of the line will be treated as a comment.

              Specify the filename as '-' to make curl  read  the
              file from stdin.

              Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config
              file, you  need  to  specify  it  using  the  --url
              option,  and  not  by simply writing the URL on its
              own line. So, it could look similar to this:

              url = "http://curl.haxx.se/docs/"

              This option can be used multiple times.

       --limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;
              Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl  to
              use.  This  feature is useful if you have a limited
              pipe and you'd prefer you have  your  transfer  not
              use your entire bandwidth.

              The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless
              a suffix is appended. Appending  'k'  or  'K'  will
              count  the  number as kilobytes, 'm' or M' makes it
              megabytes while 'g'  or  'G'  makes  it  gigabytes.
              Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.

              This option was introduced in curl 7.10.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       -l/--list-only
              (FTP) When listing an FTP  directory,  this  switch
              tory  since the normal directory view doesn't use a
              standard look or format.

              This option causes an FTP NLST command to be  sent.
              Some  FTP servers list only files in their response
              to NLST; they do  not  include  subdirectories  and
              symbolic links.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable list only.

       -L/--location
              (HTTP/HTTPS)  If  the  server  reports   that   the
              requested  page has a different location (indicated
              with the header line Location:) this flag will  let
              curl attempt to reattempt the get on the new place.
              If used together with -i or -I,  headers  from  all
              requested pages will be shown. If this flag is used
              when making a HTTP POST,  curl  will  automatically
              switch to GET after the initial POST has been done.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable location following.

       -m/--max-time &lt;seconds&gt;
              Maximum  time  in  seconds that you allow the whole
              operation to take.  This is useful  for  preventing
              your  batch jobs from hanging for hours due to slow
              networks or links going down.   This  doesn't  work
              fully  in  win32  systems.  See also the <I>--connect-</I>
              <I>timeout</I> option.

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used.

       -M/--manual
              Manual. Display the huge help text.

       -n/--netrc
              Makes  curl scan the <I>.netrc</I> file in the user's home
              directory for login name and password. This is typ-
              ically  used  for  ftp  on unix. If used with http,
              curl will enable user authentication. See  <B>netrc(4)</B>
              or <B>ftp(1)</B> for details on the file format. Curl will
              not complain if that file hasn't the right  permis-
              sions  (it should not be world nor group readable).
              The environment variable "HOME" is used to find the
              home directory.

              A  quick  and very simple example of how to setup a
              <I>.netrc</I>  to  allow  curl  to  ftp  to  the   machine
              host.domain.com  with  user name 'myself' and pass-
              <B>secret</B>

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable netrc usage.

       -N/--no-buffer
              Disables the buffering of  the  output  stream.  In
              normal  work  situations,  curl will use a standard
              buffered output stream that will  have  the  effect
              that  it will output the data in chunks, not neces-
              sarily exactly when the data arrives.   Using  this
              option will disable that buffering.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              switch on buffering.

       -o/--output &lt;file&gt;
              Write output to &lt;file&gt; instead of  stdout.  If  you
              are using {} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you
              can use '#' followed by  a  number  in  the  &lt;file&gt;
              specifier.  That variable will be replaced with the
              current string for the URL being fetched. Like in:

                curl http://{one,two}.site.com -o "file_#1.txt"

              or use several variables like:

                curl http://{site,host}.host[1-5].com -o "#1_#2"

              You may use this option as many times as  you  have
              number of URLs.

       -O/--remote-name
              Write  output to a local file named like the remote
              file we get. (Only the file part of the remote file
              is used, the path is cut off.)

              You  may  use this option as many times as you have
              number of URLs.

       -p/--proxytunnel
              When an HTTP proxy is used, this option will  cause
              non-HTTP protocols to attempt to tunnel through the
              proxy instead of merely using it  to  do  HTTP-like
              operations.  The  tunnel  approach is made with the
              HTTP proxy CONNECT request and  requires  that  the
              proxy allows direct connect to the remote port num-
              ber curl wants to tunnel through to.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable proxy tunnel.

              (FTP)  Reverses  the  initiator/listener roles when
              connecting with ftp. This switch makes Curl use the
              PORT  command  instead  of  PASV. In practice, PORT
              tells the server to connect to the client's  speci-
              fied  address  and port, while PASV asks the server
              for an ip address and port to connect to. &lt;address&gt;
              should be one of:

              <B>interface</B>   i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's
                          IP address you want to use  (Unix only)

              <B>IP</B> <B>address</B>  i.e  "192.168.10.1" to specify exact IP
                          number

              <B>host</B> <B>name</B>   i.e "my.host.domain" to specify machine

              <B>-</B>           (any  single-letter  string) to make it
                          pick the machine's default

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be
       used.

       -q     If used as the first parameter on the command line,
              the <I>$HOME/.curlrc</I> file will not be read and used as
              a config file.

       -Q/--quote &lt;comand&gt;
              (FTP)  Send  an arbitrary command to the remote FTP
              server, by using the QUOTE command of  the  server.
              Not  all  servers support this command, and the set
              of QUOTE commands are server specific!  Quote  com-
              mands are sent BEFORE the transfer is taking place.
              To make commands  take  place  after  a  successful
              transfer,  prefix  them  with  a  dash '-'. You may
              specify any amount of commands to be run before and
              after  the  transfer. If the server returns failure
              for one of the commands, the entire operation  will
              be aborted.

              This option can be used multiple times.

       --random-file &lt;file&gt;
              (HTTPS)  Specify  the  path name to file containing
              what will be considered as random data. The data is
              used to seed the random engine for SSL connections.
              See also the <I>--edg-file</I> option.

       -r/--range &lt;range&gt;
              (HTTP/FTP) Retrieve a byte  range  (i.e  a  partial
              document) from a HTTP/1.1 or FTP server. Ranges can
              be specified in a number of ways.


              <B>-500</B>      specifies the last 500 bytes

              <B>9500</B>      specifies the bytes from offset 9500  and
                        forward

              <B>0-0,-1</B>    specifies   the   first   and  last  byte
                        only(*)(H)

              <B>500-700,600-799</B>
                        specifies 300 bytes from offset 500(H)

              <B>100-199,500-599</B>
                        specifies   two   separate   100    bytes
                        ranges(*)(H)

       (*) = NOTE that this will cause the server to reply with a
       multipart response!

       You should also be aware that many HTTP/1.1 servers do not
       have this feature enabled, so that when you attempt to get
       a range, you'll instead get the whole document.

       FTP range downloads only support the simple syntax 'start-
       stop'  (optionally  with  one  of the numbers omitted). It
       depends on the non-RFC command SIZE.

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be
       used.

       -R/--remote-time
              When used, this will make libcurl attempt to figure
              out the timestamp of the remote file, and  if  that
              is  available  make  the  local  file get that same
              timestamp.

              If this option is used twice, the second time  dis-
              ables this again.

       -s/--silent
              Silent  mode.  Don't  show  progress meter or error
              messages.  Makes Curl mute.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable mute.

       -S/--show-error
              When  used with -s it makes curl show error message
              if it fails.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable show error.
              Redirect all writes to stderr to the specified file
              instead. If the file name is a  plain  '-',  it  is
              instead written to stdout. This option has no point
              when you're using a shell with  decent  redirecting
              capabilities.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       -t/--telnet-option &lt;OPT=val&gt;
              Pass options  to  the  telnet  protocol.  Supported
              options are:

              TTYPE=&lt;term&gt; Sets the terminal type.

              XDISPLOC=&lt;X display&gt; Sets the X display location.

              NEW_ENV=&lt;var,val&gt; Sets an environment variable.

       -T/--upload-file &lt;file&gt;
              This  transfers  the  specified  local  file to the
              remote URL. If there is no file part in the  speci-
              fied  URL,  Curl  will  append the local file name.
              NOTE that you must use a trailing  /  on  the  last
              directory  to really prove to Curl that there is no
              file name or curl will think that your last  direc-
              tory name is the remote file name to use. That will
              most likely cause the upload operation to fail.  If
              this  is  used on a http(s) server, the PUT command
              will be used.

              Use the file name "-" (a single dash) to use  stdin
              instead of a given file.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       --trace &lt;file&gt;
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and  out-
              going  data,  including descriptive information, to
              the given output file. Use "-" as filename to  have
              the output sent to stdout.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used. (Added in curl 7.9.7)

       --trace-ascii &lt;file&gt;
              Enables a full trace dump of all incoming and  out-
              going  data,  including descriptive information, to
              the given output file. Use "-" as filename to  have
              the output sent to stdout.

              It  makes  smaller  output  that might be easier to
              read for untrained humans.

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used. (Added in curl 7.9.7)

       -u/--user &lt;user:password&gt;
              Specify user and password to use when fetching. See
              README.curl for detailed examples  of  how  to  use
              this.  If  no  password is specified, curl will ask
              for it interactively.

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used.

       -U/--proxy-user &lt;user:password&gt;
              Specify  user and password to use for Proxy authen-
              tication. If no password is  specified,  curl  will
              ask for it interactively.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       --url &lt;URL&gt;
              Specify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy
              when you want to specify URL(s) in a config file.

              This  option  may  be  used any number of times. To
              control where this URL is written, use  the  <I>-o</I>  or
              the <I>-O</I> options.

       -v/--verbose
              Makes  the  fetching more verbose/talkative. Mostly
              usable for debugging. Lines starting with '&gt;' means
              data  sent by curl, '&lt;' means data received by curl
              that is hidden in normal cases and  lines  starting
              with '*' means additional info provided by curl.

              Note  that  if  you want to see HTTP headers in the
              output, <I>-i/--include</I> might be option you're looking
              for.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable verbose.

       -V/--version
              Displays the full  version  of  curl,  libcurl  and
              other  3rd  party  libraries  linked  with the exe-
              cutable.

       -w/--write-out &lt;format&gt;
              Defines what to display after a completed and  suc-
              ables.  The string can be specified as "string", to
              get read from a  particular  file  you  specify  it
              "@filename"  and  to  tell  curl to read the format
              from stdin you write "@-".

              The variables present in the output format will  be
              substituted  by  the value or text that curl thinks
              fit, as described below. All variables  are  speci-
              fied like %{variable_name} and to output a normal %
              you just write them like %%. You can output a  new-
              line  by  using \n, a carriage return with \r and a
              tab space with \t.

              <B>NOTE:</B> The %-letter  is  a  special  letter  in  the
              win32-environment,  where all occurrences of % must
              be doubled when using this option.

              Available variables are at this point:

              <B>url_effective</B>  The URL that was fetched last.  This
                             is  mostly meaningful if you've told
                             curl to follow location: headers.

              <B>http_code</B>      The numerical code that was found in
                             the last retrieved HTTP(S) page.

              <B>time_total</B>     The total time, in seconds, that the
                             full operation lasted. The time will
                             be  displayed with millisecond reso-
                             lution.

              <B>time_namelookup</B>
                             The time, in seconds, it  took  from
                             the  start  until the name resolving
                             was completed.

              <B>time_connect</B>   The time, in seconds, it  took  from
                             the  start  until the connect to the
                             remote  host  (or  proxy)  was  com-
                             pleted.

              <B>time_pretransfer</B>
                             The  time,  in seconds, it took from
                             the start until the file transfer is
                             just  about  to begin. This includes
                             all pre-transfer commands and  nego-
                             tiations  that  are  specific to the
                             particular protocol(s) involved.

              <B>time_starttransfer</B>
                             The time, in seconds, it  took  from
                             the  start  until  the first byte is
                             the time the server needs to  calcu-
                             late the result.

              <B>size_download</B>  The  total amount of bytes that were
                             downloaded.

              <B>size_upload</B>    The total amount of bytes that  were

              <B>size_header</B>    The  total  amount  of  bytes of the
                             downloaded headers.

              <B>size_request</B>   The total amount of bytes that  were
                             sent in the HTTP request.

              <B>speed_download</B> The average download speed that curl
                             measured for the complete  download.

              <B>speed_upload</B>   The  average  upload speed that curl
                             measured for the complete upload.

              <B>content_type</B>   The Content-Type  of  the  requested
                             document,  if  there was any. (Added
                             in 7.9.5)

       If this option is used several times, the last one will be
       used.

       -x/--proxy &lt;proxyhost[:port]&gt;
              Use specified HTTP proxy. If the port number is not
              specified, it is assumed at port 1080.

              This option overrides  existing  environment  vari-
              ables  that  sets proxy to use. If there's an envi-
              ronment variable setting a proxy, you can set proxy
              to "" to override it.

              <B>Note</B>  that all operations that are performed over a
              HTTP proxy will transparantly be converted to HTTP.
              It  means that certain protocol specific operations
              might not be available. This is not the case if you
              can  tunnel  through  the  proxy,  as done with the
              <I>-p/--proxytunnel</I> option.

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used.

       -X/--request &lt;command&gt;
              (HTTP)  Specifies a custom request to use when com-
              municating with the  HTTP  server.   The  specified
              request  will  be used instead of the standard GET.
              Read the HTTP 1.1  specification  for  details  and
              of LIST when doing file lists with ftp.

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used.

       -y/--speed-time &lt;time&gt;
              If  a download is slower than speed-limit bytes per
              second during a  speed-time  period,  the  download
              gets  aborted.  If  speed-time is used, the default
              speed-limit will be 1 unless set with -y.

              This option controls transfers and  thus  will  not
              affect  slow connects etc. If this is a concern for
              you, try the <I>--connect-timeout</I> option.

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used.

       -Y/--speed-limit &lt;speed&gt;
              If  a  download is slower than this given speed, in
              bytes per second, for speed-time  seconds  it  gets
              aborted. speed-time is set with -Y and is 30 if not
              set.

              If this option is used several times, the last  one
              will be used.

       -z/--time-cond &lt;date expression&gt;
              (HTTP) Request to get a file that has been modified
              later than the given time and date, or one that has
              been modified before that time. The date expression
              can be all sorts of date strings or if  it  doesn't
              match  any  internal ones, it tries to get the time
              from a given file name instead! See the <B>GNU</B> <B>date(1)</B>
              or  <B>curl_getdate(3)</B>  man  pages for date expression
              details.

              Start the date expression with a dash (-)  to  make
              it  request  for  a document that is older than the
              given date/time, default  is  a  document  that  is
              newer than the specified date/time.

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              will be used.

       -Z/--max-redirs &lt;num&gt;
              Set  maximum   number   of   redirection-followings
              allowed.  If -L/--location is used, this option can
              be used to prevent curl from following redirections
              "in absurdum".

              If  this option is used several times, the last one
              (HTTPS) Forces curl to use SSL version 3 when nego-
              tiating with a remote SSL server.

       -2/--sslv2
              (HTTPS) Forces curl to use SSL version 2 when nego-
              tiating with a remote SSL server.

       -0/--http1.0
              (HTTP) Forces curl to issue its requests using HTTP
              1.0 instead of using its internally preferred: HTTP
              1.1.

       -#/--progress-bar
              Make  curl  display  progress  information   as   a
              progress bar instead of the default statistics.

              If this option is used twice, the second will again
              disable the progress bar.

<H2>EXIT CODES</H2><PRE>
       There exists a bunch of different error  codes  and  their
       corresponding  error  messages  that may appear during bad
       conditions. At the time of this writing,  the  exit  codes
       are:
